# RoboHash.Net

Create RoboHashes with C# and .NET

## Overview

RoboHashes are great a way to visualize something that is hard to distinguish by humans like user ids, thumbprints, public keys.
This implementation generates for any input the same RoboHash as the [original implementation][robohash-src].

## Why?

The problem I had with them is that they are generated using [phython][robohash-src] but my complete environment is based on C# and ASP.NET.
I wanted to create them using C# code and also be able to integrate them in intranet-only applications. That is the reason why
I ported the original [phython code provided by Colin Davis][robohash-src] to C#.

## Example

For the input _test_ this library generates the following RoboHash

![test for C#](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/q6ygqgj0gowiml6/test.png)

which is the same as the RoboHash generated by [Robohash.org][robohash] (keeping fingers crossed):

![test for Robohash.org](http://robohash.org/test)
